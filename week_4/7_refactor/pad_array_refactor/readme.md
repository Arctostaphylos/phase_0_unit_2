# U2.W4: Review, Refactor: Pad an Array

## Learning Objectives
- Identify and explain what code is doing
- Implement new methods to solve a problem

## Directions
Here's your opportunity to deepen your understanding of coding principles. In this challenge, you'll review some of your cohort members solutions and then modify your solution to implement new tricks. 

### 1. Review Others
Find two solutions to the pad an array exercise you found particularly enlightening. Give them feedback on their solution. Tell them what you liked about it. 
Copy their code into your `my_solution.rb` file and run the rspec to make sure they work. (You will need to comment out all solutions except the one you are testing)

### 2. Refactor Yours
Copy your initial solution into the `my_solution.rb` file. Then, in the "refactored solution" section, re-write your solution using the new tricks you learned. 
**Make inline comments explaining your additions!** (How does this code work?  Why did you add it? What makes it better code?)  


### 3.  Test your new solution
Comment out all other solutions in your file and run the spec file. Your code should pass all of the tests. 

### 5. Reflect
Reflect on your learning in the file. Use the [reflection guidelines](../week_2/reflection_guidelines.md) to guide your reflection. ***NOTE: Reflections are mandatory!***
