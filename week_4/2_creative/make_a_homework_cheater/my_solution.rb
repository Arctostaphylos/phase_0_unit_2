# U2.W4: Homework Cheater!


# I worked on this challenge [by myself].
# 1. Template
# template = "NAME lived in DATE. HE/SHE was an important person. THESIS. I have learned a lot about NAME 's contribution."
# topic1 = "George Washington lived in 1776. He was an important person. He chopped down a cherry tree, but did not lie. I have learned a lot about George Washington's contribution."
# topic2 = "Harrison Ford lived in 1976. He was an important person. He is my favorite movie actor. I have learned a lot about Harrison Ford's contribution."
# topic3 = "Marie Curie lived in 1903. She was an important person. She discovered radioactivity. I have learned a lot about Marie Curie's contribution."

# 2. Pseudocode

# Input: Name, Date, Gender, Thesis
# Output: string that follows the template
# Steps: 
# create a hash to store the name, date, gender and thesis.
# add each value from the parameters to the hash
# define a pronoun variable that will be "he" if gender is male, "she" if gender is female
# puts a string with the hash values interpolated.
