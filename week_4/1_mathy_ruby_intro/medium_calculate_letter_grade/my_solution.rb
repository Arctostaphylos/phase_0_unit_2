# Complete each step below according to the challenge directions and 
# include it in this file. Also make sure everything that isn't code
# is commented in the file.  

# I worked on this challenge [by myself].

# 1. Pseudocode

# What is the input? an array
# What is the output? (i.e. What should the code return?) a string with the letter grade
# What are the steps needed to solve the problem?
# set a variable called average equal to the sum of the array divided by the array.length
# set up a case statement so that the letter grade is returned for each range of the average
