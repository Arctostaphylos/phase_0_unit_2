# select on an array returns a new array of elements for which the code
# block returns true. In this case I was testing whether each element in
# the source array included a particular letter.
# select on a hash returns a hash of the key/value pairs for which the
# code block is true. In this case, I was testing whether the age matched 
# the value 3. In order to return an array of the pet names, I called #keys
# on the resulting hash.

# could chain a method after a code block, but it worked!
