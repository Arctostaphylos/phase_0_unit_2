## Release 2: Basic Git Commands
Define the following commands and describe how they work/what they do.  


#### add
add stages changes to files. It essentially brings the files to git's attention and tells
git to pay attention to the file.

#### branch
creates a new branch - essentially a timeline of commits and changes

#### checkout
allows you to look at a different branch, and navigate there. If you've got multiple
branches that you're working on, you can use this command to switch between them.

#### clone
will clone a remote repo into a newly created directory. It automatically creates a remote
called "origin" and sets up a local branch

#### commit
commit is the command to tell git to take a snapshot of the file or files you're working on.
commit usually includes a message or description of the commit.

#### fetch
fetch also pulls files from a remote branch, but creates a local copy of the remote
branch without merging.

#### log
log lists the commits in reverse chronological order. 

#### merge
merges the changes you made to your local branch with another branch like the master branch

#### pull
pull changes from the remote branch to your local repo on your machine, automatically merges
any changes with the local branch.

#### push
pushes changes to remote branch, like GitHub

#### reset
reset basically undoes the most recent commit and resets the head and the index to the 
previous version of the file.

#### rm
removes files from the git index so that they are no longer tracked

#### status
shows the current state of the files and directories in your repo.
