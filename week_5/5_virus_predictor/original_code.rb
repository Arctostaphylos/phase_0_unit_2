# because instance variables are available to any method in the class - they are associated with
# a particular object, like the object alabama created below. As long as self is the object alabama
# the instance variables created when alabama was initialized will be availble to any method call
# received by the object alabama

  #private methods can't be called with an explicit receiver. If you put the private above the
  #virus_effects method, the state objects that are created by initialize would not be able
  #to call the method. The method virus_effects can call the private methods because the receiver
  #in this case is self and isn't directly specified.
