# U2.W5: Die Class 2: Arbitrary Symbols


# I worked on this challenge [by myself].

# 2. Pseudocode

# Input: an array of strings
# Output: a randomly selected string from the array 
# Steps: for initialize - set up two variables, one is the array, the other is the array.length
# sides will return array.length
# roll will calculate a random number between 0 and array.length, and use that as an index
# to return one of the strings from the array.


# 3. Initial Solution

class Die
  def initialize(labels)
  end

  def sides
  end

  def roll
  end
end
